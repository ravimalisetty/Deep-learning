# Deep Learning

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in deep learning.
It contains structured notes, assignments, and end-to-end projects implemented
primarily using PyTorch.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in neural networks
and modern deep learning techniques by implementing models from scratch,
understanding their internal workings, and applying them to practical problems.

## Repository Structure

- **Neural Network Fundamentals**  
  Core deep learning architectures and concepts, including feed-forward neural networks,
  CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, encoder–decoder models, and Transformers.  
  Each architecture is implemented to understand its design, training process,
  and limitations.

- **Natural Language Processing**  
  Applied NLP projects and experiments built on top of deep learning concepts,
  such as text classification, tokenization, embeddings, and sequence modeling.

- **Assignments**  
  Practice exercises and experiments aimed at reinforcing theoretical concepts
  through hands-on implementation.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy, Pandas (as required)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for analysis and visualization)

## Notes
This repository is intended as a learning and experimentation space.
The focus is on clarity, correctness, and conceptual understanding rather than
state-of-the-art performance.
