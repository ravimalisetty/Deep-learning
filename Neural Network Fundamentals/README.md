# Neural Network Fundamentals

This folder contains implementations of core neural network architectures in PyTorch.
Each subfolder focuses on a specific architecture, implemented from scratch to understand
its internal working, training process, and practical usage.

Covered architectures:
- Feed Forward Neural Networks
- RNN, LSTM, and GRU
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Encoder–Decoder models
- Transformers
