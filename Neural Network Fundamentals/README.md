# Neural Network Fundamentals

This folder contains implementations of core neural network architectures using PyTorch.
Each subfolder focuses on a specific architecture and is implemented from scratch to
understand its internal workings, training process, and practical use cases.

The goal of this section is to build a strong foundation in deep learning by studying
how different neural network architectures evolved and how they address specific
limitations of earlier models.

## Covered Architectures

- Feed Forward Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)  
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)  
- Encoder–Decoder (Sequence-to-Sequence) Models  
- Transformers
