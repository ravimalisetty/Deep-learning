# Natural Language Processing

This section focuses on applying deep learning techniques to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks. It builds on the core neural network fundamentals and demonstrates how text data can
be processed, represented, and modeled to solve real-world language problems.

The implementations in this folder emphasize understanding the complete NLP pipeline,
from raw text preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference. The goal is to
develop practical intuition for solving NLP problems rather than relying solely on
high-level libraries.

## Core NLP Concepts Covered

### 1. Text Preprocessing
Preparing raw text for modeling, including:
- Lowercasing and text normalization
- Removing noise and special characters
- Tokenization
- Handling out-of-vocabulary words
- Padding and truncation

---

### 2. Text Representation
Converting text into numerical form that models can understand:
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- TF-IDF
- Word embeddings
- Sequence-based representations

---

### 3. Sequence Modeling
Understanding how sequential data is handled using neural networks:
- RNN-based models
- LSTM and GRU for long-term dependencies
- Encoder–Decoder architectures
- Attention mechanisms

---

### 4. NLP Tasks
Implementation of common NLP tasks such as:
- Text classification
- Sequence-to-sequence learning
- Language modeling
- Basic information extraction

---

### 5. Training and Evaluation
- Defining appropriate loss functions
- Selecting evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Error analysis and model improvement

## Projects and Experiments

This folder includes hands-on NLP experiments and projects that demonstrate:
- End-to-end NLP pipelines
- Model training from scratch
- Fine-tuning and experimentation
- Deployment-ready inference logic

## Learning Objective

The objectives of this section are to:
- Understand how textual data is processed and modeled
- Learn how deep learning architectures are applied to NLP tasks
- Gain hands-on experience with building NLP systems end to end
- Develop the ability to select appropriate models based on problem definition

This section prioritizes clarity, correctness, and learning over state-of-the-art
performance and focuses on building strong foundational skills in NLP.
